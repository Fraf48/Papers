# Academic & Research Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my research portfolio. This repository contains a collection of technical reports and practical projects developed during my academic studies.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. Applied Deep Learning: CNNs and Transfer Learning
**Type:** Practical Assignment Project
**Technologies:** PyTorch, torchvision, Python, Google Colab

A two-part deep learning project focusing on image classification tasks.
* **Part I (CIFAR-10):** Design and training of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch, optimized to achieve over 82% mean-Class Accuracy.
* **Part II (STL-10):** Implementation of a middle-fusion strategy combining pre-trained architectures (ResNet and MobileNet V3) via Transfer Learning to leverage features from complex models on a smaller labeled dataset.

You can find the code for this project and results in our [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Rrj1FgM0I2p9t6K0ECumSJsWvIf8sQYn?usp=sharing)
  
### 2. Exact and Heuristic Techniques for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
**Type:** Technical Report & Comparative Analysis
**Technologies:** Python, C, CPLEX, Matplotlib

A comprehensive study comparing various algorithmic approaches to solving the symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The project involves implementing and benchmarking algorithms across standard TSPLIB instances.
* **Heuristics:** Nearest Neighbor, Extra-Mileage, 2-OPT refinement.
* **Metaheuristics:** GRASP, Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms.
* **Exact Methods:** Branch-and-Cut and Benders' Decomposition using **IBM ILOG CPLEX**.
* **Matheuristics:** Hard-Fixing and Local Branching hybrids.

### 3. Carbon Footprint of AI Agents: Review of Current Research
**Type:** Literature Review & Research Paper
**Focus:** Sustainable AI, Green AI, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

An investigative paper reviewing the environmental impact of large-scale Artificial Intelligence deployment.
* Analyzes key metrics for energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of Generative AI models (e.g., LLMs, Stable Diffusion).
* Examines current "Green AI" initiatives, including cloud optimization, model efficiency techniques, and carbon footprinting tools.
* Discusses methodological limitations in current measurements and proposes future research directions for sustainable AI development.
